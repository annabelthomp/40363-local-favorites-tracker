Reflection: 
Working on my Local Favorites Tracker helped me truly understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript each serve different purposes in web development. Before this project, I thought of them as one combined skill, but now I see how distinct they are. HTML gives the page structure, and CSS controls how it looks, the colors, fonts, and layout. But JavaScript is what makes it all come together. Without it, my tracker would have just been a static list. With JavaScript, users can add their favorite places, remove them, and see updates instantly. It’s the difference between a website that simply shows information and one that actually interacts with you and holds your information. 
I also gained a lot of knowledge about localStorage. Before I implemented it, my app would lose all of the data every time I refreshed the page, which made it feel useless as a website. Once I learned to use localStorage, everything changed on the page. Now the user’s favorites stay saved even after closing the browser. I had this accomplished early on, however had some mishaps after that made everything go away, but I have finally found a fix for this. These changes make the app feel more real and professional. It also taught me that small technical details can completely transform user experience. Without localStorage, my project wouldn’t be practical for daily use.
Another major thing I learned was understanding event listeners. They’re the reason the app actually responds to the users. When someone clicks “Add Favorite,” an event listener triggers a function that adds their input to the array, redoes the list, and saves it. It was fun to see how just one line of code could create an entire chain of interactions. Before this project, I didn’t fully know what made a webpage interactive, but now I do and feel as though this will make for more exciting webpages in the future. 
The hardest part for me was inputting the correct code, but the website was not working. Sometimes the button wouldn’t work, or the saved favorites wouldn’t show up after reloading. I relied heavily on the console to track what was going wrong. When I got stuck, I used the console, which was incredibly helpful for understanding each of the functions. I also occasionally used the AI agent associated with Visual Studio Code to explain concepts or help debug small errors, but I always made sure I understood why a fix worked before using it. That process made me more confident in solving problems on my own.
If I wanted to improve the Local Favorites Tracker for actual daily use, I’d start by adding more personalization and functionality. This could be more options for certain elements they want to track, or even a specific favorites tracker for one type of thing, like only restaurants. Integrating Google Maps would also make the tracker even more useful, allowing users to get directions with one click or being able to find a place on their map. A visual element, too, like uploading photos or adding more notes, could make it feel more personal and fun to use as well. Overall, this project allows for many others to come with it, for example, to-do lists, habit trackers, or even favorite movies lists!
